         <h1>Partial Least Squares Regression and Principal Components Regression</h1>
         <introduction>
            <p>Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Principal Components Regression (PCR) are both methods to model a response variable
               when there are a large number of predictor variables, and those predictors are highly correlated or even collinear.  Both
               methods construct new predictor variables, known as components, as linear combinations of the original predictor variables,
               but they construct those components in different ways.  PCR creates components to explain the observed variability in the
               predictor variables, without considering the response variable at all.  On the other hand, PLSR does take the response variable
               into account, and therefore often leads to models that are able to fit the response variable with fewer components.  Whether
               or not that ultimately translates into a more parsimonious model, in terms of its practical use, depends on the context.
            </p>
            <p>This demo illustrates the difference in how the two methods construct components by applying both methods to the same data
               set, using functions in the Statistics Toolbox(TM).

            data are described in Kalivas, John H., "Two Data Sets of Near Infrared Spectra," Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory
            Systems, v.37 (1997) pp.255-259.

</pre><p>Ten components may be more than will be needed to adequately fit the data, but diagnostics from this fit can be used to make
            a choice of a simpler model with fewer components. For example, one quick way to choose the number of components is to plot
            the percent of variance explained in the response variable as a function of the number of components.

</pre><p>In practice, more care would probably be advisable in choosing the number of components.  Cross-validation, for example, is
            a widely-used method that will be illustrated later in this demo.  For now, the above plot suggests that PLSR with two components
            explains most of the variance in the observed <tt>y</tt>.  Compute the fitted response values for the two-component model.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">[Xloadings,Yloadings,Xscores,Yscores,betaPLS] = plsregress(X,y,2);
yfitPLS = [ones(n,1) X]*betaPLS;
</pre><p>Next, fit a PCR model with two principal components.  The first step is to perform Principal Components Analysis on <tt>X</tt>, using the <tt>princomp</tt> function, and retaining two principal components. PCR is then just a linear regression of the response variable on those
            two components.  It often makes sense to normalize each variable first by its standard deviation when the variables have very
            different amounts of variability, however, that is not done here.

</pre><p>In a sense, the comparison in the plot above is not a fair one -- the number of components (two) was chosen by looking at
            how well a two-component PLSR model predicted the response, and there's no reason why the PCR model should be restricted to
            that same number of components. With the same number of components, however, PLSR does a much better job at fitting <tt>y</tt>.  In fact, looking at the horizontal scatter of fitted values in the plot above, PCR with two components is hardly better
            than using a constant model.  The r-squared values from the two regressions confirm that.

</pre><pre class="codeinput">RSS_PCR = sum((y-yfitPCR).^2);

</pre><p>It's a little hard to see without being able to interactively rotate the figure, but the PLSR plot above shows points closely
            scattered about a plane. On the other hand, the PCR plot below shows a cloud of points with little indication of a linear

</pre><p>The fact that the PCR curve is uniformly higher suggests why PCR with two components does such a poor job, relative to PLSR,
            in fitting <tt>y</tt>.  PCR constructs components to best explain <tt>X</tt>, and as a result, those first two components ignore the information in the data that is important in fitting the observed
            <tt>y</tt>.
         </p>
         <h2>Fitting with More Components<a name="15"></a></h2>
         <p>As more components are added in PCR, it will necessarily do a better job of fitting the original data <tt>y</tt>, simply because at some point most of the important predictive information in <tt>X</tt> will be present in the principal components.  For example, the following figure demonstrates that the difference in residuals
            for the two methods is much less dramatic when using ten components than it was for two components.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">yfitPLS10 = [ones(n,1) X]*betaPLS10;

</pre><p>Both models fit <tt>y</tt> fairly accurately, although PLSR still makes a slightly more accurate fit.  However, ten components is still an arbitrarily-chosen
            number for either model.
         </p>
         <h2>Choosing the Number of Components with Cross-Validation<a name="17"></a></h2>
         <p>It's often useful to choose the number of components to minimize the expected error when predicting the response from future
            observations on the predictor variables.  Simply using a large number of components will do a good job in fitting the current
            observed data, but is a strategy that leads to overfitting.  Fitting the current data too well results in a model that does
            not generalize well to other data, and gives an overly-optimistic estimate of the expected error.
         </p>
         <p>Cross-validation is a more statistically sound method for choosing the number of components in either PLSR or PCR.  It avoids
            overfitting data by not reusing the same data to both fit a model and to estimate prediction error. Thus, the estimate of
            prediction error is not optimistically biased downwards.
         </p>
         <p><tt>plsregress</tt> has an option to estimate the mean squared prediction error (MSEP) by cross-validation, in this case using 10-fold C-V.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">[Xl,Yl,Xs,Ys,beta,pctVar,PLSmsep] = plsregress(X,y,10);
</pre><p>For PCR, <tt>crossval</tt> combined with a simple function to compute the sum of squared errors for PCR, can estimate the MSEP, again using 10-fold
            cross-validation. PCRmsep = sum(crossval(@pcrsse,X,y,'KFold',10),1) / n;
         </p>
         <p>%% % The MSEP curve for PLSR indicates that two or three components does about % as good a job as possible.  On the other
            hand, PCR needs four components % to get the same prediction accuracy. plot(0:10,PLSmsep(2,:),'b-o',0:10,PCRmsep,'r-^'); xlabel('Number
            of components'); ylabel('Estimated Mean Squared Prediction Error'); legend({'PLSR' 'PCR'},'location','NE');
         </p>
         <p>In fact, the second component in PCR <i>increases</i> the prediction error of the model, suggesting that the combination of predictor variables contained in that component is
            not strongly correlated with <tt>y</tt>.  Again, that's because PCR constructs components to explain variation in <tt>X</tt>, not <tt>y</tt>.
         </p>
         <h2>Model Parsimony<a name="20"></a></h2>
         <p>So if PCR requires four components to get the same prediction accuracy as PLSR with three components, is the PLSR model more
            parsimonious?  That depends on what aspect of the model you consider.
         </p>
         <p>The PLS weights are the linear combinations of the original variables that define the PLS components, i.e., they describe
            how strongly each component in the PLSR depends on the original variables, and in what direction.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">[Xl,Yl,Xs,Ys,beta,pctVar,mse,stats] = plsregress(X,y,3);
plot(1:401,stats.W,<span class="string">'-'</span>);
xlabel(<span class="string">'Variable'</span>);

legend({<span class="string">'1st Component'</span> <span class="string">'2nd Component'</span> <span class="string">'3rd Component'</span>},<span class="string">'location'</span>,<span class="string">'NW'</span>);
</pre><p>Similarly, the PCA loadings describe how strongly each component in the PCR depends on the original variables.</p><pre class="codeinput">plot(1:401,PCALoadings(:,1:4),<span class="string">'-'</span>);
xlabel(<span class="string">'Variable'</span>);
ylabel(<span class="string">'PCA Loading'</span>);

</pre><p>For either PLSR or PCR, it may be that each component can be given a physically meaningful interpretation by inspecting which
            variables it weights most heavily.  For instance, with these spectral data it may be possible to interpret intensity peaks
            in terms of compounds present in the gasoline, and then to observe that weights for a particular component pick out a small
            number of those compounds.  From that perspective, fewer components are simpler to interpret, and because PLSR often requires
            fewer components to predict the response adequately, it leads to more parsimonious models.
         </p>
         <p>On the other hand, both PLSR and PCR result in one regression coefficient for each of the original predictor variables, plus
            an intercept.  In that sense, neither is more parsimonious, because regardless of how many components are used, both models
            depend on all predictors.  More concretely, for these data, both models need 401 spectral intensity values in order to make
            a prediction.
         </p>
         <p>However, the ultimate goal may to reduce the original set of variables to a smaller subset still able to predict the response
            accurately.  For example, it may be possible to use the PLS weights or the PCA loadings to select only those variables that
            contribute most to each component.  As demonstrated earlier, some components from a PCR model fit may serve primarily to describe
            the variation in the predictor variables, and may include large weights for variables that are not strongly correlated with
            the response. Thus, PCR can lead to retaining variables that are unnecessary for prediction.
         </p>
         <p>For the data used in this demo, the difference in the number of components needed by PLSR and PCR for accurate prediction
            is not great, and the PLS weights and PCA loadings seem to pick out the same variables. That may not be true for other data.

% important predictive information in |X| will be present in the principal
% components.  For example, the following figure demonstrates that the
% difference in residuals for the two methods is much less dramatic when
% using ten components than it was for two components.

% Both models fit |y| fairly accurately, although PLSR still makes a
% slightly more accurate fit.  However, ten components is still an
% arbitrarily-chosen number for either model.


%% Choosing the Number of Components with Cross-Validation
% It's often useful to choose the number of components to minimize the
% expected error when predicting the response from future observations on
% the predictor variables.  Simply using a large number of components will
% do a good job in fitting the current observed data, but is a strategy
% that leads to overfitting.  Fitting the current data too well results in
% a model that does not generalize well to other data, and gives an
% overly-optimistic estimate of the expected error.
%
% Cross-validation is a more statistically sound method for choosing the
% number of components in either PLSR or PCR.  It avoids overfitting data
% by not reusing the same data to both fit a model and to estimate
% prediction error. Thus, the estimate of prediction error is not
% optimistically biased downwards.
%
% |plsregress| has an option to estimate the mean squared prediction error
% (MSEP) by cross-validation, in this case using 10-fold C-V.
[Xl,Yl,Xs,Ys,beta,pctVar,PLSmsep] = plsregress(X,y,10);
%%
% For PCR, |crossval| combined with a simple function to compute the sum of
% squared errors for PCR, can estimate the MSEP, again using 10-fold
% cross-validation.
% PCRmsep = sum(crossval(@pcrsse,X,y,'KFold',10),1) / n;
% 
% %%
% % The MSEP curve for PLSR indicates that two or three components does about
% % as good a job as possible.  On the other hand, PCR needs four components
% % to get the same prediction accuracy.

%%
% In fact, the second component in PCR _increases_ the prediction error
% of the model, suggesting that the combination of predictor variables
% contained in that component is not strongly correlated with |y|.  Again,
% that's because PCR constructs components to explain variation in |X|, not
% |y|.


%% Model Parsimony
% So if PCR requires four components to get the same prediction accuracy as
% PLSR with three components, is the PLSR model more parsimonious?  That
% depends on what aspect of the model you consider.
%
% The PLS weights are the linear combinations of the original variables
% that define the PLS components, i.e., they describe how strongly each
% component in the PLSR depends on the original variables, and in what
% direction.
[Xl,Yl,Xs,Ys,beta,pctVar,mse,stats] = plsregress(X,y,3);
plot(1:401,stats.W,'-');
xlabel('Variable');
ylabel('PLS Weight');

%%
% Similarly, the PCA loadings describe how strongly each component in the PCR
% depends on the original variables.

xlabel('Variable');
ylabel('PCA Loading');

%%
% For either PLSR or PCR, it may be that each component can be given a
% physically meaningful interpretation by inspecting which variables it
% weights most heavily.  For instance, with these spectral data it may be
% possible to interpret intensity peaks in terms of compounds present in
% the gasoline, and then to observe that weights for a particular component
% pick out a small number of those compounds.  From that perspective, fewer
% components are simpler to interpret, and because PLSR often requires
% fewer components to predict the response adequately, it leads to more
% parsimonious models.
% 
% On the other hand, both PLSR and PCR result in one regression coefficient
% for each of the original predictor variables, plus an intercept.  In that
% sense, neither is more parsimonious, because regardless of how many
% components are used, both models depend on all predictors.  More
% concretely, for these data, both models need 401 spectral intensity
% values in order to make a prediction.
%
% However, the ultimate goal may to reduce the original set of variables to
% a smaller subset still able to predict the response accurately.  For
% example, it may be possible to use the PLS weights or the PCA loadings to
% select only those variables that contribute most to each component.  As
% demonstrated earlier, some components from a PCR model fit may serve
% primarily to describe the variation in the predictor variables, and may
% include large weights for variables that are not strongly correlated with
% the response. Thus, PCR can lead to retaining variables that are
% unnecessary for prediction.
%
% For the data used in this demo, the difference in the number of
% components needed by PLSR and PCR for accurate prediction is not great,
% and the PLS weights and PCA loadings seem to pick out the same variables.
% That may not be true for other data.
